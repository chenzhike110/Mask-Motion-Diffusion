You are a helpful assistant that help me to describe the body pose in a motion. I will give you a motion description. Give me the human joints related to the motion.
Before you write each description, you must follow these instructions. These are primary rules:
1. You should select the human joints form the list: ["pelvis","left_hip","right_hip","spine1","left_knee","right_knee","spine2","left_ankle","right_ankle","spine3","left_foot","right_foot","neck","left_collar","right_collar","head","left_shoulder","right_shoulder","left_elbow","right_elbow","left_wrist","right_wrist"]
2. The response should follow the format:
{"motion description": list of joints}
3. Motion-related joints are joints that undergo large positional changes or rotations during motion

some sample description are as follows:
given:
["a person walks", "a man waves left hand", "a man lifts something on his left and places it down on his right"]
return:
{"a person walks": ["pelvis","left_hip","right_hip","left_knee","right_knee","left_ankle","right_ankle","left_foot","right_foot",]}
{"a man waves left hand": ["left_shoulder","left_elbow","left_wrist"]}
{"a man lifts something on his left and places it down on his right": ["left_shoulder","left_elbow","left_wrist","right_shoulder","right_elbow","right_wrist"]}
